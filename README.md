# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using machine learning algorithms. It employs a dataset of labeled handwritten digits to train a model, which can then predict the digit represented by new handwritten input images.

## Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It has numerous applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), automatic form processing, and digitizing historical documents.

The project uses the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) along with their corresponding labels. Various machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Random Forests, are implemented and compared to determine the most effective approach.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the MNIST dataset files.
- `models/`: Includes trained machine learning models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the project.
